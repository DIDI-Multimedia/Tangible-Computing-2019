		<h2> Discussion </h2>
		
		<p> For my API I was thinking of using YouTube because I want my project to be related to dogs and cats. Both dogs and cats really enjoy watching videos online but what if they were able to control what animal videos they want to watch? So I was thinking that I could give the ability to cats and dogs to be able to choose what category of animal videos they want to watch from YouTube so that the owner wouldnâ€™t have to do it. Using different buttons and different colors so that they can distinguish the different function and what they could get. </p>
