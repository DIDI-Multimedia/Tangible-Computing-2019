		<h2> Discription </h2>
		
		<p>  I started my idea for project one with water, I wanted to create this page that sinks with water. I just thought it would look nice if I could make it related to time. But I felt like my idea wasn’t clear so I had to connect it with a concept. I thought why not make it an awareness of saving water since individuals are never extremely mindful of how much water they waste, but if they get to visualize it they will consider how to utilize water less. 

I needed to connect this to the cape town water crisis since it left an entire city nearly come up short on water. People were told not to flush the toilets in public places, which is a very big safety hazard that can spread infection, creating even more chaos. It was told that showering shouldn't take longer than two minutes and that it's better to reuse water. Toward the end, individuals began truly focusing on how they utilized water which truly helped saving cape town from drought. They’ve banned filling pools and fountains since they can be consuming. For now, the issue in cape town is tackled yet the hazard is still there and the issue can rise once more. 

I felt like if I wanted to show how much water we waste then we should visualize it, so I got a few informational indexes online that I figured I could use for my code. It’s a data set from a single city in the united states. It indicates the high utilization of water and how it changes consistently. I explored it more and utilized that data to fuse in my code. My data sets incorporated the years from the 1980s to 2018, yet I chose to simply go with the years from 2013 - 2015. It's better to demonstrate the ongoing years with the goal that individuals perceive how it grows rapidly. 


Toward the start of testing, I wanted to go with Perlin Noise and add it to my Data code, but I realized that it was unnecessary and there are numerous different ways about how I could communicate my ideas, I looked at some processing examples and it truly helped me to begin with my code. I decided to go with a circle with rotating lines, in which the length of the lines represent the year, the colors represent the year after or before 2015, and the speed of the movement determines how much water is wasted, the faster it means more water consumption. 

So I ended up going with that as my final idea, which I started working on. But I had a lot of difficulties since it was the first time using a data set with coding, I needed to play a ton with the information and attempt to figure how I can make my information control my code and how it works.i took a lot of trials but I was to go finish the final one. </p>
