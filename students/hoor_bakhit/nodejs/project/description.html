		<h2> Description </h2>
		
		<p> We made a project to solve the problem of cat's zoomies. zoomies is a word used to describe a cat with very high energy, so we made a project that will keep the cat busy until it's zoomies are gone.Our project distracts the cat and makes it play, while it plays it tweets to twitter to update us when its playing, that way we get to know when out cat is busy playing and has zoomies  </p>
