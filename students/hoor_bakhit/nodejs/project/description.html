		<h2> Description </h2>
		
		<p>Our project is called Zoomies, it is a toy for cats that facilitates burning excess energy. It uses sensors that initiate the movement on the feathers, or objects attached, and sends you updates when your cat is having zoomies. The word zoomies stands for a normal behavior that cats have, usually kittens, which is a great way for them to burn off energy. Which sometimes leads the cats frantically running or jumping around. As per our research, we found that kittens have that energy in them and it could inspire older cats to have this sort of behavior as well. We initially were interested in this topic because it is something that we see happening around us a lot on the daily in a cat owner’s house so we wanted to dig deeper into it. We wanted to create something that will deal with that extra energy rather than a person having to play with the cat to reduce it’s those zoomies. We also wanted to include the study of API and our learnings from coding and implement it into one idea. Our research continued and led us to the topic of why we created this specific look of the object. The idea behind it was that we wanted to create something that is cat-friendly, which means, cats love climbing objects, going around them, or just watching from a far. So we created an oval shape, that allows cats to act these behaviors. The choice of the material was wood and the reason behind it was for the object to be durable, and aesthetically pleasing to the human. In a way where you can place it in your house without it worrying about disturbing the house aesthetics and color pallet. After creating the object we moved on to code we had to connect it to Johnny five and install node for it to be able to connect to the local server. After that, we had to do the circuitry of the Arduino connections and use ultrasonic sensors to be able to detect that cat’s movement. Then by using the API of Twitter, we connect it to Arduino to give us updates on when your cat is using the toting and getting zoomies. This helps cat owners be able to see specifically when the cat is super energized and they’ll be able to analyze their pets behavior and playing schedule. By doing this we get to understand why animals act in a certain way and how to deal with it. It helps us further explore and allows us to be able to improve this project later on in the future to better fit each cat based on its personality. As designers, we will analyze the situation furthermore and alter our project for the better. </p>
