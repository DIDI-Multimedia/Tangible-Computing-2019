		<h2> Discussion </h2>
		
		<p>  A project that inspired me was a project of my own with my two partners. The project was about creating an abstract representation of a swarm movement through kinetic wave structure. It has a triangular formation representing the individual elements of the swarm, with a transforming structure that happens through human interaction. I started this project with enthusiasm and hope that ill do well and it wont be too hard. We made our mockups and it looked like we were going through the right path. We had a very good plan with a lot of details. As we started working into it we faced many problems including assembly, resource and many more. It felt like the project was falling apart because we had no idea what do to, we spent days trying to find a solution. But we went through each problem together and solved them slowly by giving an alternative material or changing the size or shape. It took us a lot of time and a lot of hard work. Each person in the team had a very important role that needed to be done. We had really good teamwork and I was glad that I worked with them till the end. The project turned out amazing and everyone fell in love with it. What inspired was even if there are hard times or difficulties there will always be a solution. The result turns out amazing and your hard work pays off. I just wanted to say this story just in case anyone goes through a hard time and faces the same problem to never give up. </p>
