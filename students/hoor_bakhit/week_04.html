		<h2> Discussion </h2>
		
		<p>  The future of user interfaces is going to be so much different that what we have now. Even though what we have now is so fascinating. I was really shocked by the physical scale model of architectural buildings, it really shows how you can visualize data and information in a different and delivers the idea to look much clearer. I think that this should be the purpose of tangible user interface, in which it would benefit people and shows them a new way of understanding. Maybe in uses for medical purposes or school education. Especially for people that suffer from dyslexia since visual learning is much easier.

So my project talks about the water crisis and the purpose is to have awareness towards saving water. I think it would be really cool if it had tangible user interface in which the data  visualization of the water consumption would be able to be seen in a physical way, like a moving structure, or a color changing object. There many options out there so it would be very interesting to look into how we can visualize it more. It’s something that we can explore better in the future when we are a bit more advanced in coding. Maybe then creating installations or having exhibitions.

Starting to code was difficult , it is a very confusing topic and it takes a lot of time to learn. After coding I realized how much time takes to make simple command and I started appreciating the people who code as a career. Because as I started to realized that you need to learn a lot of things to be good at it. My relationship with the computer is still the same though, I haven’t grown to love it because I still didn’t get the hang of it and I don’t think I’m good at it.</p>
