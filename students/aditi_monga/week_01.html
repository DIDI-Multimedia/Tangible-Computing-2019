			<p> My relationship with technology began when I was born -- but I'll spare the details and discuss only the recent digital aspects. I clearly recall playing Road Rash on the ancient Microsoft computer at the age of four. I reminisce about binge-watching YouTube videos when I was 6 because we didn't have a TV in Mexico. I remember getting my first iPod touch at the age of eleven like it was yesterday. Point is, I can't imagine my life without anything digital being in it. 

	The iPod introduced me to a whole new world with its massive selection of applications. I discovered photo editing, silly voice editors, stop motion creators, VFX applications to enjoy with friends and family, the possibilities were endless. I believe this "era" of my life was responsible for my love for multimedia, which is ironic since I'm not a huge fan of Apple.

	Shockingly, I'm learning multimedia now. Wow. I hope I can learn film-making in this course (or at least any one aspect -- cinematography, VFX, sound production, editing, etc.). It's no secret I am passionate about film and storytelling, thus I'm largely biased about this "topic" or "big idea". 

	I also hope we are formally taught graphic design and photoshop -- not just self-learning the skills, but how to go about the aesthetics, choosing colours and fonts, typography, layouts.

	My biggest fear is not being able to have enough time to learn the skills necessary. We either have time to make a high effort submission mostly altered from the internet and not understand a majority of the material, or we can pick up multiple skills perfectly yet submit a low effort, unimpressive submission. It's not easy balancing so many modules and submissions. Being stress-prone doesn't help, I get worried easily. I want to learn as much as possible, I love picking up new skills, but it's obvious no one can perform well under crushing stress.

	I hope everything goes well, I can't wait to grow with the course. </p>
