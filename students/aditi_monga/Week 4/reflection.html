		<h3> Progress: </h3>

		<p>For my P1 Project, I am planning to use music to measure time. It will not follow our standard metric system of hours, minutes and seconds, but instead, find a new way to measure the time passed based on the BPM (beats per minute) of the songs. </p>
		<p> For example, Green Day’s “Boulevard of Broken Dreams” is 86 BPM and is 4:20 mins long. The code will basically record time as approximately 370 units. Let’s say the next song on the playlist is Lady Gaga’s “Bad Romance”, with a BPM of 119 and length of 4:54 mins. That would cover approximately 590 units. In today’s new hits, Taylor Swift’s “Lover” is 69 BPM, and 3:41 mins long. That would be approximately 251 units. By the time you have finished listening to these three songs, 1,211 units of time have passed. This logic plays around with chronoception, feeling like time is slowing down when a slow song plays, whereas feeling that time passed by quickly when a fast song plays. </p> 
		<p> If I could make this music clock tangibly accessible, I would do something around the old Windows Media Player. As a child, I always wanted to be able to stick my hand into the mesmerising patterns, I think it’ll be super interesting to be able to “feel” music. Maybe
		heavy bass makes the material stiff, strings make the object dough-like, and Skrillex makes the material brittle – because why not. </p> 
		<p> As for how coding is changing my relationship with computers, it hasn’t altered much yet. The most I do is inspect commercial webpages to see their codes sometimes or watch tutorials. It’s been only 4 weeks, so I’m not surprised by the fact that I haven’t been influenced much. If coding were the only thing I had to do with no other responsibilities over a long period of time, then yes, I believe there would be a drastic change in my answer. </p>
