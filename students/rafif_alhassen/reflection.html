		<p> My P1 project is based around the concept of overthinking and how time to me passes or does not base on my thoughts. I am going to be using thoughts as a measurement of time. For me, thoughts define the speed of time. The more one overthinks the slower time flies. The less one overthinks the faster time flies. Each thought carries a different emotion and with it a different feeling. These emotions determine how fast or slow time passes.

		I have always been someone who overthinks. The intensity of one’s thoughts affects how slow or fast time passes. The more one dwells on thoughts, the slower time passes. For me, an escape from my thoughts would be using my phone as a distraction. Using my phone helps me suppress some feelings but also triggered other feelings. Thoughts carry such a stronghold on the way we feel and our emotions and vice versa.

		Having a tangible interface that shows one of their collected thoughts would be interesting. Especially if one could control their thoughts. Being able to see and suppress them through some kind of hologram would be very fascinating. Physically seeing something that is invisible such as one’s collected thoughts organized in a specific manner could help one understand themselves better.

		<br>

		As my website aesthetic is still being developed, I intend on keeping my website as minimal as possible to avoid triggering thoughts within the user. I would like to keep the colors grayscale and nothing more as a part of the theme. However, the explorations will contain color as a part of my experimentation.
