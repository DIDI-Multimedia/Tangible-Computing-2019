		<p> Technology has become a huge part of my daily life. I rely on technology for almost everything, that without it, I feel flustered. This is becoming a problem as each generation is becoming progressively addicted. This is turn makes our addiction to technology normalized. Normalizing technology has drastically affected our ability to stay concentrated in real life tasks. Which is affecting our productivity levels, and our urge to do something that requires more effort than using your phone. 

		<br>

		<br>

		While technology allows us to stay connected it also disconnects us from reality. Technology aids us in ways that allow us to progress as a society. However, it is being abused and changing us in ways we would have never imagined. The applications we become so addicted to are designed to keep us hooked and in that, they are succeeding. We need to use design for the greater good of humans not of companies. Design should enhance our quality of life but not detriment it in ways we cannot change. Habits.

		Being able to use technology for the greater good through coding is something I want to achieve eventually, whether it is coding for machines for hospitals or simply to aid children in learning. My goals for this course are to understand how to successfully write code for JavaScript & Html from scratch dependent on what I would like to achieve. I hope to be able to code with more confidence. My biggest fear is not grasping how to code. Being able to code and solve my own errors would boost my confidence and of course my understanding, allowing me to continuously improve.
