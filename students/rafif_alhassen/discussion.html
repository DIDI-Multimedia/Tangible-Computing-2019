		<p> As Dostoyevsky once said, “To think too much is a disease”. As humans, we tend to overthink situations which results in a multitude of unnecessary stress as we get lost in our thoughts. We tend to focus on the bad and ignore the good. This creates a lot of internal conflict between ourselves and our minds. Do you ever just want to shut your mind off for a moment of peace?



		<br>

		<br>

		Not only do we create inner conflict but we can also slow down or speed up time-based on our thoughts. I have always been an over-thinker. I always find myself thinking the worst of situations and this results in a lot of stress on my part. This makes time pass slowly as I begin to get lost in my thoughts mentally and emotionally. Overthinking is a disease of the mind that can eventually drive you crazy. 



		<br>

		<br>

		Ever since I have become an anxious person, I have found myself overthinking constantly. Thinking began to become a method of how I measured time. My thoughts defined time. The more I get lost in emotional thoughts, the slower I find time to pass. The less in-depth I think, the faster I feel time passing. With each thought, an emotional weight is carried and depending on how negative that weight is, time will pass either faster or slower. I felt encouraged to explore the way I could illustrate how overthinking can define time as it is something many people including myself struggle with daily.



		<br>

		<br>

	This exploration was based on the concept of measuring time through human thoughts. A random thought is generated as you click within the boundaries of the ellipse. These thoughts are generated based on different sets of arrays. The use of color in this sketch is tied down with emotions as our emotions are usually associated with color depending on the thought itself. As the mouse is pressed and a new thought has generated the canvas as well as the thought changes color. The thoughts also have a lifespan to replicate the way our thoughts either linger or fade away after a certain amount of time. The font size is also changing within the boundaries of 80-150 to keep the generated thoughts legible. The size also represents the strength of our thoughts. The thoughts that appear also rotate to illustrate how our thoughts are random and pretty much all over the place. I also added a 3D blur effect to replicate the disorder and the randomness of our thoughts. Furthermore, I added smileys and some punctuation marks that are randomly generated into each thought.  



		<br>

		<br>

		The main reason for incorporating the mouse pressed function was to make the sketch more interactive. This also allows the user to control the number of thoughts that appear and where they appear. Making it interactive creates an emotional interaction between the user and the sketch. However, when the user does not click within the boundaries of the ellipse thoughts are generated as they are no longer in the human ‘head’.
