	<h2> Sketch 1: Further Experimentation with Video - <strong> <u> Blurry Vision </strong> </u></h2>
	<h3> For this week, I selected 2 sketches to further advance towards my Clock. The concept of my abstract clock is to be able to visualize a "moment of madness" - an experience that tries to recreate a minute of panic. To recreate this in terms of time, I'm going to try and represent different symptoms and their progression as separate units of time. i.e: Gradual Blurry Vision, rapid heartbeat, tingling sensation, as seconds, minutes, and hours. And constantly changing them to represent different hours (perhaps by adding tint? 24 different shades?) </h3>
