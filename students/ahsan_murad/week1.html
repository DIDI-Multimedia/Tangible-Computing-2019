         		<h3>I remember playing Aladdin on a Windows computer when I was around 8. This wasn't my first interaction with a game, I had played video games on basic consoles before, but this was my first interaction with a desktop computer. I remember having a high fever the day our desktop computer, probably a windows 98, was installed in our house. I remember not wanting to miss out but still being heavily advised bed rest by my parents. The next day however, since I got to miss school (yay), I spent the entire day completing different levels on it by myself. I was in love, and I couldn't stop playing, with anything I could get my hands on, on the computer. Through out the next few years, I remember learning how to take a physical computer apart and re assembling it. I even remember taking html classes (although the tags seem like a different language today) and building Harry Potter and horror (don't ask me why I was just obsessed with fire gifs) themed websites on Microsoft Frontpage, a pretty famous Visual Editor, not dissimilar to Powerpoint or Word with the exception of hyperlinks, just for fun. 
		<br>
		Through out the entire period since then, I have also become interested in Graphic Design, Motion Graphics, Film, & Animation. Film and storytelling is particularly an interest where I always thought of focusing my studies in. Prior to DIDI, I even took a few courses such as "Introduction to Cinema" and "Art of Filmmaking" back at School of Interactive Arts & Technology, SFU. 
		<br>
		When I learned about the DIDI option of specializing in 2 majors, I immediately knew that this would be a great match for me: I'm also a bit of a commitment-phobe, and wanted to branch out instead of focusing on one particular area. This is because I strongly believe innovation is best achieved when multiple areas of knowledge are combined together.
		<br>
		When I discovered the subject of Interaction Design, it was all of my interests coming together in one topic. Film, animation, story telling, graphic design, product design, all merging together to emanate in one form of design. Add to that my love for fashion and wearables, and to able to design interactions between tangible and visual media, that remains my core topic of interest.
