		<h6> Nikhilesh Mohan </h6>

    <p>only known as Nik, Nikhi or Nikhil is a visionary whose passion   <br/> 
       is to create and innovate for a better today. Currently in his    <br/> 
       2nd year of design school, he is pursuing a dual concentration    <br/>
       degree in Product and multimedia design hoping to bridge the      <br/>
       gap between man and machine.                                      <br/>
     </p>
     <p>His ethos is driven by the desire to seek and learn anything and       <br/>
        everything possible to apply design in an array of mediums and         <br/>
        see how they coexist. One of his peculiar interests is in Artificial   <br/>
        Intelligence and how it can be made into just A.nother I.diot that     <br/>
        can enhance our day to day life.                                       <br/>
     </p>

     <p>An immense fascination in stories, photography and technology          <br/>
        put together influences his rationally crazy ideas and the drive       <br/>
        to make them a reality. One such crazy goal, if not the most           <br/>
        ambitious one is to impact the lives of a billion people through       <br/>
        design.
