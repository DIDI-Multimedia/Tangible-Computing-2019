		<h6> Radical Atoms </h6>

     <p>Reading through the paper was a highly enlightening experience,        <br/>
        it is definitely in line with what I have been trying to explore              <br/>
        which is the idea of what is the future of UI and bridging the                <br/>
        interactive gap between man and machine.                                      <br/>
     </p>

     <p>The idea of radical atoms opens up the world of interaction to an             <br/>
        array of new opportunities that creates a unique synergy between physical     <br/>
        and digital interactions. A really interesting excerpt from the reading was   <br/>
        "it is critical that both tangible and intangible representations are         <br/>
        perceptually coupled to achieve a seamless interface that actively mediates   <br/>
        interaction with the underlying digital information and appropriately         <br/>
        blurs the boundary between physical and digital."                             <br/>
     </p>

     <p>Enhancing digital interactions by fusing it with tangible objects would       <br/> 
        pave the way for an ideal path to the future of UI giving us gestural and     <br/>
        personalized access to information at our fingertips, quite literally !       <br/>
        My aim in the field of multimedia would be to expand our capability of        <br/>
        interfacing with the digital realm from small, smaller and tinier screens     <br/>
        to large projections and gestural controls that not only involes our fingers  <br/>
        but encourages our complete involvement almost like hugging our machines.     <br/>
