		<h1> Week One </h1>
		
		<h4> Discussion </h4>
		
		<p> With the world facing new problems and new opportunities everyday, if not every minute,     <br/>
		a good question to ask oursleves would be are we ready for it ? In my humble opinion we are     <br/>
	    still miles away from unlocking our true potential which makes me think are we ready to accept  <br/>
	    what tomorrow has to offer for us. For example it is very obvious that there is a feud with the <br/>
	    inclusion of Artificial Intelligence in various fields and very few people like Elon Musk and   <br/>
	    Jeff Bezoz constantly try to pioneer in the field despite the hurdles, but if we go back in time<br/> 
	    a bit there were people who shuned the smartphone away, today can we even think of a second     <br/>
	    without them around ? It is this idea of tackling the people's mentality for the greater good   <br/>
	    which will be key in taking us to humanity's next step. </p>

		<p> The first step we can take in that direction is closing the gap between man and machine.        <br/>
		 A powerful synergy between biology and technology can unlock a variety of unforeseen possibilities <br/>
		 and it may start with how we interact with our machines. Currently we treat machines as a heap of  <br/>
		 things put together to complete a task. Our perspective towards these machines are completely      <br/>
		 devoid of character and emotion. If we can shift our perspective and imagine a scenario where      <br/>
		 the machine connected with us and suggested a better way of doing something and we had an          <br/>
		 optimistic approach to that, how much more productive could we be. It also important to analyze the<br/>problems that AI might bring with it such as bias based on the data it is given, the difficulty of <br/>integrating empathy and its ability of only making rational decisions often neglecting human factors.</p>

		<p> I will leave you with a line Thanos mentions in Endgame,                                        <br/>
		"As long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be." </p>
