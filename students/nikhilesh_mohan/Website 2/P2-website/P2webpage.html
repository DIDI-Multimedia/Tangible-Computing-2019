    This project explores the idea of creating a tangible digital interface, rescuing people from their daily interaction with small, </br>
    smaller and tinier screens.Todayâ€™s technology deserves due credit for enhancing our lives drastically. We started off as mere </br>
    cave dwellers but today we can envision a future in a completely different planet all thanks to the growing technology around </br>
    us. Unfortunately, this rapid growth has neglected many key factors that are 
    slowly starting haunt us.

    Today our interactions are vastly limited to just touching a block of glass, over time turning humans into a static </br>non-active being. If we notice, these technological interactions are also limited only to the fully capable and neglects</br>
     those with disabilities. I believe a key priority for technology is to enhance the lives of those with disabilities</br> rather than excluding them from the system, alienating them further from the community. Sentient aims at </br>taking human-digital interactions to its next step by allowing us to actively interact with technology and making it </br>accessible to various groups of people essentially making them one. </br>
    </br>
    This form of interaction uses Posenet as a foundation and builds upon its capabilities, allowing our physical movements</br>
    to trigger digital commands. This creates a digital space where information is given a coordinate allowing us to tap the</br>z-axis of interaction, helping us move away from our glass blocks. This method of interaction helps to personalize </br>interactions and tune the system to custom triggers. For example a person with limited motor skills can have a model </br>trained to his scope of movements and the digital commands adapt to those interactions, creating a seamless way of </br>interacting with technology for the disabled. My goal with this method of interaction is to push digital interactions to</br> its next phase optimizing the way we access and utilize information to push humans to its next phase, from being just </br>human to sentient. </br>
