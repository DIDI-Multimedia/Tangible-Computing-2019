		<div class="box"><p> I can't help but wonder how technology is the one thing that can always evolve yet we can't find solutions to all the problems going on in the world. For that reason I have illustrated each webpage dedicated to on-going issues that are either the child of climate change or the reason behind it or issues that coming up on daily. Along with that I will link some sort of data visualisation website that will show users clearly how bad the effect really is. I want to use technology as a means of showing what is truly going on in this world rather than focusing on the different ways of achieving a certain number of likes and followers on a  platform that will eventually seize to exist.  </p> </div>
