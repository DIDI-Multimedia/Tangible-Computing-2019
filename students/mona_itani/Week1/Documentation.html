     For this project, I initially began playing around by drawing different forms of illustrations on different topics for each week and linking them to websites that teaches the audience about the topic dedicated for that particular week, however after learning how to connect to twitter with arduino, I was inspired to use a form of social media as an education tool rather than a entertainment tool.  </p>

     <p>My initial project was Re-cultured. A remote control dedicated to educating people about one another. However, I wanted to move a way from just connecting it to a television since, no one really watches TV anymore since everything is availabe online. Everyone is constantly glued to their phones. So what if instead of constantly recieving tweets of what someone is constantly up to they would recieve documentaries, educational videos or traditional music from different cultures.   </p> 


        <p> so this is what I have done: <a href="word.pdf"> Explanation with visuals</a> </p>
