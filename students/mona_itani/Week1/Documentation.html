		><p> When it comes to culture, people almost always choose to observe customs and practices in several different ways - and sometimes, they do not at all. For many people, their culture and religion are an essential part of their lives. While for others, religion and culture are only mildly present in their lives and for some it is not present at all. In either case, the scenario of a positive or negative viewpoint of said culture is always at stake. A demographic study conducted by Pew Research has shown that more than eight in ten people identify with a religious group and 5.8 billion adults and children consider themselves religiously affiliated. With this in mind, the question of how far do oneâ€™s culture and religion affect their day-to-day lives rose. In this day and age, especially in a city like Dubai, the majority of the population are immigrants. Almost every day someone meets someone new from a different nationality, age, religion, and gender. </p>

    <p>For this project, I initially began playing around by drawing different forms of illustrations on different topics for each week and linking them to websites that educate the audience about the topic dedicated for that particular week, however after learning how to connect to twitter to Arduino, I was inspired to use a form of social media as an education tool rather than an entertainment tool. </p>

     <p>My initial idea revolved around Re-cultured. A remote control dedicated to educating people about one another. The remote includes four categories, gender, age, nationality, and religion. However, the way it works is different than how a normal remote control would. For example, once you choose your gender. You will be redirected to a documentary about a different one, so if you are a man then you will watch a documentary about feminism. If you are a woman then you will watch a documentary about transgender men. But, it does not stop there.</p>

     <p>My project also delves into the realm of music, especially with age and nationality. The reason being is, with age, older generations are not open to what recent generations enjoy listening to and vice versa. With nationality, the aim is to teach one another about the different traditional music each country has to offer.</p>


     <p> However, I wanted to move away from just connecting it to television since, everything is available online. Everyone is constantly glued to their phones. So, what if instead of constantly receiving tweets of what someone is constantly up to they would receive documentaries, educational videos or traditional music from different cultures.  </p> 


        <p> so this is what I have done: <a href="documentation1.pdf"> Explanation with visuals</a> </p>
