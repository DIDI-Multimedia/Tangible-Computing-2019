			Telling time is something I never thought was a big deal or how cruical it is to tell time. When I think of time the first thing that comes to my mind is a timed bomb. The bomb is usually lit up and as time passes the thread reaches closer to the bomb, it explodes. I thought that I might combine my favrotie item with the idea of a bomb to create a time telling machine. I thought of about cats and confetti, and thought of using all what I have learned and more to create an Exploding Cat. A grumpy cat that starts blowing up for 57 seconds and blows up into a confetti for 3 seconds, which calculates 60 seconds in total.
