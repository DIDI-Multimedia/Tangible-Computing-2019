		<div class="box"><p> Humans are social, we always talked about relationships as they are critical for us. And in this specific relationship we spend most of our time with technology more than our human relationships. Technology plays a critical part in our lives, we became very dependent on technology that could have a good and bad side to it. Technology helps us better improve the world into a better place, not only the world but helps our day to day interaction by creating programs that simplify the tasks for us as I am very attached to that. Moreover, I believe my relationship with Technology is very strong, I depend on technology to better help me understand unsolved issues or guide me to create something that better enhances my tasks or projects. However, we really need to put a boundary to the relationship with technology just like any other relationship in a humanâ€™s life. The iPhone has features that lock the use of the apps for limited amount of time to motivate you to use your phone less, which is really beneficial since the first thing we do in the morning is that we go through our phones and waste time by doing that. Even though Technology is sewn into our lives, just like how we made technology we can make a boundary to stop it from over exceeding the limit. 

		My goals in this course is for me to get rid of the fear I have of codes. I always find myself stuck and nervous when I see codes in-front of me, I might understand it easily but its very hard for me to do it by myself and I would love to achieve that skill. And the big idea I would love to explore is Multimedia, it has many beautiful and interesting aspects to it. And I am not the biggest fan of expecting things to happen. Since I believe it takes aways that joy of knowing whats next and being super excited about creating something. However, I know for sure that it's going to be a lot of interesting topics I never knew I had an interest in, like creating a Technology, which I just figured I have a strong relationship with.
