		<h1> Week One </h1>
		
		<hr>

		<h2> Reflection </h2>
		
		<p> 
		Something you should know about me is for short term goals (a daily/weekly/monthly goal) I plan them out to the T. But for long term goals I prefer going with the flow and seeing what I learn and where life takes me. So for this course, for weekly assignments I want to be able to create things that I will be able to impress my most unimpressed friends with. For the overall long term goal of this project I want to see what I learn throughout the semester and see what the outcome of all those little things will be when put together. 
		<br>
		<br>
		An idea I would like to explore futher would be creating something that has both a physical and non-physical elements. Like how would I be able to create an experience where you could interact with something in real life but then it can create a reaction on a screen or vice versa. That would be cool. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Biggest fear?
		<br>
		<br>
		Falling behind...
		<br>
		<br>
		There's so much content in this course that I'm afraid of losing control and missing work and being left behind. Because catching up is probably one of the hardest things to do. - I say this as I write this assignment 2 weeks late :)
