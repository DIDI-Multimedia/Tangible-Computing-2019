		<h2> Proposal Sketches </h2>
		
		<p> I got 2 ideas at this point for this project. The way I started was I thought about what I use to tell the time besides a clock. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<b><center>Idea 1</center></b>
		<br>
		<br>
		My first thought was my mom calling. As the day goes on she calls me more often which I connect to the time. For example; she would call at around 1 pm, then again at around 4 pm, then again at around 6 pm, then at 8 pm, then 9 pm, after that she'll most likely call every 30/40 mins until I go to bed. 
		<br>
		So my proposal for this would be a phone that "rings" more often as the day goes on.

		<br>
		<b><center>Idea 2</center></b>
		<br>
		<br>
		The second idea I had for this was jeans.
		<br>
		The way your jeans fit in the morning vs the evening. In the morning your jeans tend to fit tighter and be more fitted, then as the day goes on it become looser and baggier.
