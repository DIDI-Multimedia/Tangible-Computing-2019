My name is Anabella Milner and I am currently a multimedia and strategic design managment student at the Dubai Institute of Design and Innovation (DIDI). Design, to me, represents the way in which we shape the world. Combining the arts, humanities and technology, design allows an oppurtunity to envision a greater tomorrow that benefits both the individual and comunity as a whole. Through my exploration of design, therefore, I hope to one day benefit the lives of others through finding creative solutions. Furthermore, design depicts a form of expression and storytelling. In my opinion, this is equally valid as I aspire to start discussions to generate change.
