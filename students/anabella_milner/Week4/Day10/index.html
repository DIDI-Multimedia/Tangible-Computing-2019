	<p>This weeks given reading, ‘Radical Atoms: Beyond Tangible Bits, Toward Transformable Materials,’ was fundamentally thought provoking. Though I had often previously considered graphical user interfaces (GUI’s) as a way of the future, I hadn’t properly imaged a world in which the tangibility of a physical object could be manipulated with the use of the Digital world. In this way, both physical and digital spaces as we know now could, one day, be dramatically altered as they continue to merge. The concept of defying the current restraints of objects excites me, as it could transform our current definition of the physical world to incorporate some of the qualities we witness daily digitally. The opportunities that will undoubtedly arise from the radical atoms vision of the future is, there for, beyond our imaginations.</p>

<p>In terms of my P1 project, I can only imagine how it would appear and function as a tangible interface. As I am still in the exploratory phase of developing my assignment, I am still not certain of its direction. I have been primarily exploring the concepts of ‘glitch’ and ‘flow’ through peril noise and webcam input. This, I hope to combine to show how the way in which we experience time varies depending on our state of mind. This could also represent the idea of memories, and how these are often blurry to us and pictured in a way that reflects our personal feelings towards each. </p>

<p>As a tangible interface, perhaps this could be portrayed as an installation that plays with shape and color over time, in response to the emotions picked up from those around it. In this way, the object appears to have emotions of its own, responding to others through reflecting a visual representation of emotions and how these change over time. Perhaps the shape moves more rapidly when the object is to show harsher emotions, and slower when in calmer states. Such as time moves when we too experience said feelings. The colors could likewise became harsher when experiencing strong emotions, and more pastel when more placid. </p>

<p>As I continue to experiment with coding, I am gaining an increasing appreciation for the software in my every day life. Often as users, we see these items as simple, as using them is often fairly straightforward. Coding has truly made me understand the complexity involved and made me often question how things are done. </p>
