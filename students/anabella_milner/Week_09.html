For the second project of the semester, I would love to explore an idea I had prior to beginning multimedia design. This idea was inspired by an incident that occurred at my previous school a year ago, in which a student drowned. After conducting further research, I found swimming related fatalities to be one of the highest causes of childhood death in the UAE. I hoped that through design, this could be countered, with a device to send an alert directly to the swim coach or to the pool vacinity as it detects any sign of distress. This could be measured through detecting the individuals heartrate, pool level or movement. This could be in the form of individual wristbands or sensors made to scan the entire pool, etc. An alert could then be sent to a guardian present or the entire pool vacinity. If individual wearables were present, a light could indicate the childs location within the pool. I would hope this could eventually become a design that would be effective in households or public settings (schools, public pools, etc).   </p>
