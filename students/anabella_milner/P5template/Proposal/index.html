	<p>Throughout the past week, I have had a variety of ideas for what my proposal could be. At first I thought it would be interesting to explore the concept of telling the time through ones heartbeats. It is estimated that every ten seconds, someone dies and every 7, someone is born. Perhaps after every 7 counts a new pulse appears and afer every 10, a pulse flatlines. 

	Another idea I had was to explore the circulation of blood around a body, perhaps having the bloodstream re-enter the heart after a certain amount of time. Lastly, and most preferably, was the concept of following a life to measure time. In this, an eye would open, signifying the beginning of a life. A variety of images and sounds could then become evident (eg. a bicycle, a wedding dress, etc) in the reflection of the characters eye. Perhaps even, her emotions could be explored as she may sped a tear or have redder eyes when tired. This could end with eyes closing again after a certain amount of time (eg. 10 seconds), and the loop beginning again.  Other ideas I had, yet have not drawn were to explore the moon cycle to tell time, or the lifecycle of a butterfly. </p>
