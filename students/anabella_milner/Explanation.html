Tasked with representing the concept of time using code, I found myself drawn to the exploration of memories. Referring to the ‘faculty by which the mind stores and remembers information,’ memories present time in a way that is unstructured and undefined (Lexico Dictionaries | English, 2019). When reflecting on our past experiences, often only a few important moments stand out vividly. The remainder are often neglected, seen instead as a distorted blur. Due to this, my exploration began with the experimentation of ‘glitch,’ to highlight the neglection of the duration of an experience. Contrasting glitch, I also investigated the idea of ‘flow’ to emphasize the dream like quality of more memorable experiences.  As our predominant memories stay with us for a lifetime, time could be said to be infinite within them. Implementing the webcam as the eye in which memories are witnessed, video was used to represent memories, with some appearing clearer than others. I aimed to distort the footage in a variety of ways, as we do not always view our past experiences in the same manner.  Throughout each of my explorations, I aimed, therefore, to demonstrate various recollections, intensifying the clarity of only a few moments. I find that each of the sketches I have explored represent various ways of distorting memories, as we remember occurrences varyingly. 

 Moreso, while vivid images aren't necessarily clear when reflecting on past experiences, we often recall the emotions experienced in certain moments distinctly, with these emotions intensifying over time. Through our emotions, distinct aspects of experiences are viewed as more memorable than others (Heshmat, 2015).  In this way, the concept of time is often warped to adjust to our perspective of the memory. I find it interesting that in various individuals minds, their perception of a situation appears differently. In my sketches, I explored the use of colour to represent this. Certain colours aimed to encourage certain emotions in the viewer. In other explorations, pixels within the image were swapped and morphed to represent distorted recollections. Many of these involve few pixels being remembered from past movement, giving the appearance that one is deconstructed and reconstructed in ones memories, with the clearer images representing the moments of greatest importance.  In the latest version of my sketch, sections of the image that are static are replaced with black pixels, with only the parts of the image that display motion visible and emphasized. The movement of one's silhouette is remembered and portrayed. In this way, if you were to stay still, the sketch would camouflage you into the background. This aims to represent ‘distortion’ and the concept that memories do not involve every detail of an experience, and instead merely emphasize what is most significant. 

To represent my explorations, I created a short film. In this, I aimed to demonstrate the recollections of a single day. In this, only certain instances throughout the day were portrayed. Some memories moved faster than others, with ‘glitches,’ occurring between. Other memories appeared to be drawn out and more clearly recognizable. Few memories emphasized the concept of emotions, using colour to represent the feelings that surrounded that moment. When combined, the distortion of memories over time becomes apparent.   </p>
