    <h2> Summary </h2>

      <p> This week we review the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS by creating a personal website. This website that will be used throughout the semester to document and share work created by students of MuW201. </p>


    <h2> Review </h2>

      <li>Read the article<a href="http://www.papert.org/articles/ComputerAsMaterial.html" target="open">"Computer as Material: Messing about Time"</a> by Seymor Papert </a> </li>

    <h2> Deliverables </h2>

    <ul  style="list-style-type:disc;">
    
      <li><a href="https://www.github.com" target="open">  Sign-up for a <b>GitHub</b> Account </a></li>
      <li> 
        Share your GitHub user-name with your professor immediately so they can add you to the class repository.
      </li>
      <li> 

        Start your personal website. Once you have access to the class github repository, you will find a folder with your name in the 'students' folder.  
        Use the template website as a starting point. Make sure your 'index.html' file contains a table of contents, listing each of the course. (week 1, week 2, week 3 ..  ect). Make sure to create a seperate webpage for each week. For example, week 1 would be documented within 'week_01.html'. 

      </li>
      <li> 

        <b> Reflection Assignment, Week 1 </b> Write 300-400 words discussing a person, project, or problem that inspires you. Please make sure to include answers to following questions in your post: What are your goals for the course? What new things would you like to learn or create? Or is there a bit problem you hope to solve? <i> (Be ambitious!)</i> ? What things have you encountered before but perhaps want to learn better? Feel free to include any sketches or images to explain your answer.

      </li>
