    <h2> Course Description </h2>
    <p>
    
      By connecting the digital world to our innate ability to grasp and manipulate objects, this course shows how computers can be just another material in a designer's toolkit. This course explores how the computer unlocks new active, exploratory materials for design investigation, experimentation, and even imagination. At the same time, students will gain insight into the unique and evolving qualities of computing and learn how to take advantage of their precision, adaptability, and extensibility, to achieve results that would otherwise be impossible to conceive of.
      The course is divided into three open-ended projects focused on solving everyday problems based on your personal interests: The first project introduces the fundamental skills required to program a computer and touches topics such as graphics and animation. The second project addresses the use of contemporary software, hardware, and data-bases to allow digital bits and physical atoms to communicate. The third and final project will explore different sensory modalities and affordances to create an interactive system for humans or non-humans. 
      This pedagogy of this course is flexible, collaborative, upside-down, and peer-to-peer. No prior programming experience is required, however, you must devote time each day to practice and apply the skills introduced in this course.

    <h2> Learning Objectives </h2>

    <ul  style="list-style-type:disc;">

      <li> 
        Evidence understanding of a broad range examples from new media artists, interaction designers, and engineers understand how they interrelate to computing 
      </li>
      <li>
        Evidence confidence with developing a repertoire to develop interactive media projects: including computing, interaction, and visualization, whereby one influences the other
      </li>
      <li> 
        Evidence confidence with documenting and publishing work online and giving and receiving peer-based critique regarding how one expresses and instantiates oneâ€™s ideas. 
      </li>
      <li> 
        Evidence proficiency working with creating applications using digital and tangible to media which incorporate multi-sensory affordances.
      </li>
