    <h2> Academic Integrity Policy </h2>

      <!-- <li>I will help make my class a great learning environment by abiding by the Ground Rules.</li> -->
<!--       <li>This is an important learning opportunity, so I will make an extra effort to be always on time. </li>
      <li>Likewise, I will submit my assignments on time.</li>
      <li>I will dedicate myself to this course as it is a core part of preparing me as a designer.</li>
      <li>During group discussions and lectures I will not text, or use my mobile telephone or laptop except during breaks or emergencies, and outside the classroom only.</li>
 -->    
<!--  I will not have side conversations knowing that I may have to share what cannot wait. 7 I will participate in every class conversation knowing that I will learn more by engaging. 8 I know that no question is stupid and by asking it I may be helping my peers. 9 If I don’t know or don’t understand I will ask as I am not expected to know everything and I am here to learn. 10 I will respect and communicate with my peers as I expect them to respect and communicate with me. 11 I will provide constructive criticism and will not pass judgment. 12 I will respect my classroom and keep it clean on arrival and departure as it is my space and that of my peers. 13 I will not eat or drink at my desk as accidents can be harmful to my and my peers’ work. 14 I will be attentive and follow instructions to ensure personal growth and efficient learning. 15 I will not whine or complain and instead of describing problems, no matter how creatively or eloquently, 16 I will provide solutions. 17 I promise to have fun and be a serious student at the same time. 18 I will be self driven, and not wait to be spoon-fed. 19 I will take initiatives and risks as I know my peers and teacher will support me.
